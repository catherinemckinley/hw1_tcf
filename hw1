When multiple people are working on the same file and edit the same lines of code, git has no way of knowing which edits to keep and which to not keep. A lot of the time, these merge conflicts occur because people will go a long time without committing their work and will change code on many files that others are collaborating on. In these cases, there are a lot of merge conflicts that occur. Unsolved merge conflicts can lead to delays since the people working on the project will have to stop the current work they are doing and fix the merge conflicts. The conflicts can also can result in code inconsistencies or even accidental loss of changes. Overall merge conflicts hinder productivity and erode trust in teammates due to lack of communication.
